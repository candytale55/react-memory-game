/**
 * Challenge:
 * 2) Create a new variable, "btnContent", and use "selectedCardEntry" and "matchedCardEntry" that you receive as props to conditionally assign a value to it. If a card is either matched or selected, "btnContent" should be the value of the "content" prop; otherwise, it should be a question mark.
 * 3) Render "btnContent" as the content of the button.
 * ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use a ternary operator to solve step 2.
